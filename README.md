# r-ladies-highcharter
This repository contains [slides](https://mpaulacaldas.github.io/r-ladies-highcharter/) and data for my presentation on the `highcharter` package for the "Data Visualization in R: from exploration to presentation" R-Ladies Paris Meetup on Nov. 9th, 2017.

This presentation gives only a glimpse into the amazing visualizations that can be produced with the `highcharter` package. For a proper introduction, check out the awesome demos and examples available at [the official package website](http://jkunst.com/highcharter/) and on [Joshua Kunst's blog](http://jkunst.com/blog/).

For my examples, I used the data from FiveThirtyEight's article ["Comic Books Are Still Made By Men, For Men And About Men"](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/women-in-comic-books/), which is available at [this Github repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/comic-characters). I also used the [2017 candy hierarchy survey data](https://www.scq.ubc.ca/so-much-candy-data-seriously/) collected by David Ng at UBC.
